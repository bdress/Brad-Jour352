<div id= "intro">
<p id= "descriptiontop"> <strong id= "strong"> Storytelling is my passion, </strong> and I am a tenacious novelist, reporter, photographer and filmmaker based out of Crofton, Maryland. I found my interest in storytelling and writing as a young child. Oftentimes, I was scribbling stories on loose leaf paper or drawing comic strips. In college, I have taken my storytelling and writing abilities to the fields of journalism, creative writing, and film. I have a unique talent in a variety of works in the art of writing: I strive to display a pronounced zest for crime and dramatics, but I am eager to write about almost anything, and I will continue a career in writing to further explore deeper and more creative aspects.

<br> <br> Outside of the classy introductions, I am, first and foremost, a creative writer who wants to tell powerful stories, whether that is through fiction or nonfiction, or even visually through films and photographs. The power of narrative is one that has always enthralled me-- my life, love and ambitions revolve around delivering powerful stories in as many ways as I can tell them.

<br> <br> I have a trained but always growing mentality toward shaping narrative through a variety of mediums. I have produced short films, self-published novels on Amazon, and have worked for a swath of newspapers and magazines, both writing, photographing and laying out pages. Through extensive schooling, I have learned to master most web and tech elements, including the Adobe Suite and Microsoft Office Suite.  I am also experienced in photography, film and managing junior writers and collaborating with graphic design and photography teams. I have learned basic web coding as well, and I believe all of these elements serve as launch pads toward my end-goal: creating and producing stories.

<br> <br> I, of course, simply hope that the stories I strive to tell through multiple mediums will reach people's hearts-- and leave an indelible, and hopefully positive, mark on society.
