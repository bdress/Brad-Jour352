<h1 class="headline"> How One Train Threatens An Entire Community </h1>

<h3 class="byline"> By Brad Dress </h3>

<p id= "intro"> <strong> Greenbelt, a historic community in Prince George's County, Maryland, is on the verge of losing what makes it so historic in the first place. A super, high speed train might just push it off the rails. </strong> </p>

<br> <br>

<center> <img src="maglev.jpg" alt= "train picture" width= "90%"> </center>

<br> <br>

<a name="stopone"></a>

<h2 class= "chapter break"> <img src= "onetrain.png" id= "icon">Stop 1: Rising Tensions</h2>

<br> <br>

<p> <span id= "top"> Mary Edwards </span> moved to Greenbriar Condominiums in Greenbelt specifically to escape the noise of trains. </p>

<p> But a new, high-tech and speedy train might disrupt the quiet life she has worked so hard for. The state government has been exploring the possibility to allow a private company to build a Superconducting Magnetic Levitating train--which could burrow right underneath Edwards’ building, if approved. </p>

<p>To Edwards, this train threatens her smalltown, silent home in Prince George’s County because it will create noise and, possibly, structural damage. </p>

<p>“It’s going to be loud, rattly--a complete disruption,” she said. “Technology is great, but they need to think of how it affects daily lives.” </p>

 <p>While the department is still studying the environmental and human impact, and the final decision from the federal government to decide whether to build or not releases in 2020, the two finalized routes threaten to disrupt Greenbelt homes, the historic woodlands around the city and even Eleanor Roosevelt High School, the heart of Greenbelt. Department officials largely stick to the idea that the train tunnels underground and won’t disrupt homes in Greenbelt, but many residents question how loud the noise will be as it passes underneath the town; whether there will be structural damage to any homes or the school; and whether clearing land for access roads and ventilation shafts will destroy the sacred woodlands around Greenbelt and their homes.</p>

<br> <br>

<br> <br>

<p> This has many citizens in Greenbelt, who believe they will get “all the harm and none of the benefit,” up in arms.</p>

<p> Edwards doesn’t have the time to attend the rallies or protests other Greenbelters have attended to combat the Maglev, but she said her entire home is at risk, and if the government wants to take that from her, they will-- whether she speaks up or not.</p>

<p> Edwards did not plan on leaving her simplistic apartment complex with brown buildings, a small pool and a green playground, which is nestled in the sleepy part of town and surrounded by historic woodlands and far from any pollution and noise. But now she “may not want to stay here” given that the final two routes approved by the Maryland Department of Transportation will both plow through Greenbelt, according to an alternatives report released by the department in November.
In 2015, the state and federal government approved an application from the private transportation company, Baltimore Washington Rapid Rail, to further study the best routes for the Maglev train and its environmental and human impact. In the report, the government justified potentially allowing them to build the train because the “Baltimore-Washington region is one of the largest and densest population centers in the United States” and will continue to grow and face even more mass transit problems.</p>

<p> “Over the next 25 years, the population in the region is expected to increase by approximately 20 percent,” the report said. “The conditions above translate into the need to evaluate an improved mobility option of travel.”</p>

<h2 class= "chapter break"> <img src= "trains.png"> Stop 2: The Future of Public Transportation </h2>

<blockquote class= "block">"The idea of digging tunnels 80 feet underground--we really don't know if that’s going to damage the foundations of our homes or the school." </blockquote>

<p> <span id= "top"> The Maglev </span> is expected to zoom through the state for a 15-minute ride from the Capital to Baltimore and could eventually stretch to New York if the first phase succeeds. Until then, Maryland taxpayers would be stuck with the bill, said Brian Almquist, who co-founded the Greenbelt Advocates for Environmental and Social Justice with his wife, Donna, to keep the local government open to the public and to combat projects that threaten people’s quality of life. Almquist said many Greenbelters won’t use the train, which could cost as much as an airplane ticket, but still suffer the physical disruptions to the city-- and pay taxes for it.</p>

<p> “The only section that is being proposed right now is Baltimore to Washington, D.C.,” he said. “The ridership numbers would not support the cost of the project, and therefore Marylanders could get stuck with a tax bill.” </p>

<p> Almquist is so against the train, that he started an online petition on change.org called “Stop The Train: Support No Build Option.” As of March 2019, Almquist has collected roughly 470 signatures on the website.</p>

<p> Since it’s a private company building it, and since they also matched the state government’s grant to conduct the route analysis, the department is mostly focused on the routes instead of any costs, which is a future consideration. </p>

<br> <br>

<center> <img src="couplejpg.jpg" alt= "pic of Almquist couple" width= "90%"> </center>
<center> <caption> Brian and Donna Almquist, an activist couple in Greenbelt, Maryland, have launched a petition on change.org to stop the Maglev from being built, and have helmed an effort to send more than 350 letters to legislators (photo from change.org). </caption> </center>
<br> <br>

<p> In the November report, the department narrowed it to routes “J” and “J1” mostly because the first routes did not meet the requirements for “highest practical speed” and the other routes failed environmental, human and construction needs, the report said. </p>

<p> The “J” route will travel along the east side of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway with 69 percent of it tunneling underground, while “J1” cuts through the west side of it with 79 percent underground-- but both will burrow under Greenbelt.</p>

<p> Bradley Smith, the director of freight and multimodalism at MDOT, said that along with those options, there is always the “no build” alternative. And, since the Maglev tunnels underground in Greenbelt, it eliminates any environmental and human impact in the city.</p>

<p> “The majority of the project, in and around the Greenbelt area, is completely in a tunnel,” he said. “As far as impact, we’re going underground in a tunnel, a fairly deep tunnel, so that’s a way of reducing the impact on the surface, if not eliminating it altogether.”</p>

<p> But Greenbelt Mayor Emmett Jordan questioned whether there will actually be zero harm to the city. He said there were many unanswered questions concerning the areas where the Maglev races through. </p>

<p> “The idea of digging tunnels 80 feet underground,” Jordan said, “we really don’t know … if that’s going to damage the foundations of our homes or the school. The tunnels they are talking about still need ventilation shafts every quarter mile or eighth of a mile. [And] what are they going to do with all that dirt?”</p>

<p> Steve Skolnik, the president of the board of directors for Greenbelt Homes Inc., which operates homes in the city, said the Maglev will require emergency roads for maintenance. This will require land-- including homes and, most of all, the historic woodlands which surround Greenbelt. “There are about 80 or 90 acres of the original Greenbelt left, and those are undeveloped forest lands that are tremendously valuable to us,” he said.</p>

<p> The report does note that ventilation shafts are required and the “primary purpose of the ventilation structures would be to remove smoke” which could pollute the community. The company would build these shafts to be “co-located with emergency exits” and implement them every three or four miles. And these emergency exits and the viaducts the train rides on aboveground “would require permanent access roads.”</p>

<p> Smith admitted they are still studying the environmental and infrastructure impacts along the routes, and the Fall 2019 environmental impact report will bring an answer to those questions, he said. </p>

 <center><h2 class= "chapter break" id= "three"> <img src= "three.png" width= "35%" height= "25%" id= "icontwo"> Stop 3: Unheard Voices </h2> </center>
<blockquote class= "block"> "To me, Greenbelt is like a model for other communities and I don’t think it should be destroyed." </blockquote>

<p> <span id= "top"> Skolnik, the mayor </span> and Almquist have fought and lobbied on behalf of Greenbelt over the past couple of years to encourage the government to halt any train building. The mayor has worked closely with other mayors and city government officials in Prince George’s County to draft a plan of action, and Skolnik has done the same, though they admit there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered before they can formally do anything. Almquist--who formed his advocacy group in 2015 to oppose a new apartment complex in Greenbelt, which he successfully impeded--has worked hard to raise awareness of the Maglev among Greenbelters, and helmed an effort that sent nearly 350 letters to the government opposing the train. </p>

<p> Not everyone in Greenbelt opposes the Maglev, however. </p>

<p> Robert Snyder, 64, has lived in Greenbelt for 30 years, but he believes the train will benefit the community. He listed five reasons in support of it: it will create jobs; keep up with technology that other countries have implemented, such as Japan, which has its own Maglev; save time on travel; and create high-tech engineering jobs and diverse modes of transportation. </p>

<p> “If they can do it in Japan, why can’t we do it here?” he asked. “Once something is built, it’s more acceptable at that point. People will say, ‘Oh I was against it, but hey let’s ride it and take it to Baltimore.’ And if it goes to Philadelphia and New York, it goes there in an hour [or less].” </p>

<p> He also noted that there are no supporting facilities for the Maglev slated to be built in Greenbelt, and most of the train would travel underground, so there would not be much of a disturbance to the community. </p>

<br> <br>
<br> <br>

<center> <img src="park.png" alt= "park picture" width= "90%"> </center>
<center> <caption> A man walks through Greenbelt state park in April. The park, with its historic woods and trails, is thought to be in danger if the Maglev is built (Photo by Brad Dress).</caption> </center>

<br> <br>

<p> However, Donna Almquist said digging tunnels requires clearing land, and both routes pass through the historic woodlands, which will endanger a number of trees and wildlife--not to mention that the tremors of the train passing underneath could cause structural damage to Greenbelt homes. </p>

<p> This would tear up the fabric of Greenbelt, a city she calls “unique” because it is walkable, historic and environmentally-friendly. </p>

<p> “To me, Greenbelt is like a model--so many people have come to me and said to me, ‘We don’t have this here, this is a walkable community,’” she said. “This should be a model for other communities and I don’t think it should be destroyed.” </p>

<p> Maryland does suffer from a mass transit problem; in its alternatives report, MDOT admitted there was an “inadequate capacity of the existing transportation network.” But there are many other transportation services out there: Amtrak, D.C.’s Metro and Baltimore’s Light Rail, as well as existing highways that surfaced in the midterm elections as an issue.  </p>

<p> Democratic candidate Ben Jealous, who lost to Gov. Larry Hogan in November, campaigned on a long-overdue and much-needed overhaul of the mass transit system, and put Hogan under the spotlight for canceling the Red Line rail train in Baltimore. </p>

<p> Jordan, the mayor, said servicing these existing transportation infrastructures, including Amtrak, which can already zip from Baltimore to Washington, D.C. in 40 minutes or less, would revamp the system and provide the best alternative, although he doubts it will “get better” at all. </p>

<p> “We need to take advantage of the existing networks we have,” he said. “Long story short, we’re beyond the tipping point. You can add more lanes to the parkway or build a high-speed train, but it’s not going to help.” </p>

<p> Edwards, whose home, quality of life and solitude are at total risk, said people like her are threatened, and still have no voice: they are the quiet citizens who “don’t have complete control of the decision” and never will, she said. </p>

<p> “It’s going to disrupt my living environment,” she said. “The benefit is outweighed by the harm--because it’s going underneath my home.” </p>
